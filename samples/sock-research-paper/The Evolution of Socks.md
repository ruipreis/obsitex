# Historical Evolution of Socks

Socks have undergone numerous transformations throughout history. Key developments include:

- **Ancient** Origins: Early humans used animal skins and plant fibers to protect their feet from harsh environments.
- **Roman Era**: The Romans developed ‘udones,’ early knitted socks, signifying both practical use and social status.
- **Medieval Period**: Wool and silk socks became common among European aristocracy, often adorned with intricate embroidery [[@acharBackPainChildren2020]].
- **Industrial Revolution**: The invention of knitting machines revolutionized sock production, making them widely accessible.


# Modern Innovations in Sock Manufacturing

Recent advancements in sock technology include:

- **Moisture-Wicking Fabrics**: Synthetic fibers enhance breathability and moisture control.
- **Compression Socks**: Designed for improved circulation, these socks are commonly used by athletes and medical patients [[@weiFinetunedLanguageModels2022]], [[@aghajanyanIntrinsicDimensionalityExplains2020]].
- **Sustainable Materials**: Eco-friendly options like bamboo and recycled polyester reduce environmental impact [[@acharBackPainChildren2020]].
