While the concept of duck-sized horses in urban environments is largely hypothetical, its exploration reveals deeper insights into how cities accommodate non-human life. If such creatures were ever introduced, their economic, social, and infrastructural implications would need to be carefully managed to ensure harmonious integration. Future research may explore the feasibility of genetic engineering to create scalable urban livestock tailored to specific needs.
