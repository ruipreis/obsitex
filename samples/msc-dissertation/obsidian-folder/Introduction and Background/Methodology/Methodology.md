A mixed-methods approach is employed to assess the theoretical integration of duck-sized horses in urban settings. This includes:

- **Surveys**: Conducted among urban dwellers to gauge perceptions of miniature horses in public spaces.
- **Economic Simulations**: Modeled scenarios where duck-sized horses serve as transportation aids, novelty attractions, or companion animals.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Examining historical cases of animal integration in cities, such as working horses in early industrial societies and modern urban beekeeping initiatives.
